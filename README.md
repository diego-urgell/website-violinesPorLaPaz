## Project Description

During my 2021 winter vacations I, along with a friend, volunteered to create a website for an NGO, non-profit organization called "Violines Por La Paz". It is based in Tampico, Tamaulipas in Mexico, although they are currently expanding. Their objective is to provide children from marginalized families with a well-rounded education by complementing their classes. Each student chooses an artistic discipline, a sport, and a foreign language to study during a two years program in which their skills are developed. 

I became fascinated by such a noble cause, and decided to help them with the development of a website. This is important because it would help to create a more formal image for the organization. As a result, they could have a better chance at receiving sponsorships and donations. 

Even tough I'm not a designer, for this project I had to learn and apply some basic design principles, focusing on the user experience. In order to create a product that portrayed the organization's identity, several prototypes were created and modified until the client was satisfied. Later on, the interface was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some PHP. 

I really enjoyed working in this project, since it allowed me to apply my skills in order to benefit my community. I look forward to volunteering more in the creation of software for this kind of organizations. The website is currently deployed [here](https://vfpmexico.org).
